This is for selecting a IIIF resource for inclusion in the Manifest - typically, a Canvas (or Canvases) from an external manifest. It is **not** opening that external manifest for editing. Neither is it selecting a content resource such as an image, from which the Manifest Editor would make a new Canvas, or for placing on an existing canvas in the currently-being-edited manifest. 

It is launched from File -> Import.

It might offer the same IIIF Collection starting point as [[Loading IIIF for Editing]] - Model 1, or it could be the manifest editorâ€™s default starting point (Model 0)

It looks a lot like [[Loading IIIF for Editing]] because much of the interaction is identical. However:

* It is more likely to focus on navigating IIIF resources (collection browser) than opening files from other sources.
* It doesn't stop at the Manifest; the selection goes deeper, so you can pick Canvases (and later, deeper still). This is like picking slides from another deck for inclusion in yours, rather than the whole deck.
* Compared to Load and Save, this could have the fewest restrictions on where you can open from, and where you can save to. Saving will always likely be the most restricted. But Importing could allow any canvas anywhere to become part of your manifest - even retaining its external IDs (that can be an option on import).
