He first described it as \"a soluble, possibly enzyme-like contagium\". In 1886, he changed his mind and reported that it is \"bacterial, but that the infectious forms have not yet been isolated, nor are their forms of life known\". Mayer concluded that the disease had a lot of characteristics that looked like a bacterial infection, but the disease carrier could not be isolated, nor seen by microscope. This was strange, especially since these were known techniques at that time."

Ivanovski, like Mayer, was puzzled by this phenomenon. He hypothesized that the cause of the disease could be unculturable bacteria, or spores of bacteria, too small to be stopped  by the Chamberland filters. He called it a “contagion vivum fixum”, Latin for “fixed living contaminant”."

                  "He repeated this procedure several times, using new leaves each time, but the effect was equally strong each time. He thereby eliminated the possibility that this could be a chemical effect. Because if the disease was caused by a chemical, the effect would get weaker with each repeat. Next to that, heating the liquid to 90°C inactivated it. Beijerinck concluded that tobacco mosaic disease was apparently caused by something biological because it could reproduce itself and was inactivated  by heat. ",

In his spare time, he carried out research and gained his doctorate in 1877 on the subject of plant galls, which are abnormal outgrowths in plant tissue. Due to the high quality of his scientific publications, J.C. van Marken, the Director of the Netherlands Yeast and Spirits Factory persuaded him to move to Delft in 1884, to research ways of improving the quality of the factory’s products and controlling contamination problems. ",
                  "Beijerinck was not very happy as an industrial scientist because his wide range of interests did not suit the more focussed requirements of industrial life, despite the broad freedom that Van Marken gave him. In theory, he should have been working on fermentation, the yeasts involved, kefir and related analytical methods. However, during this time he published research on a very wide range of topics including different sorts of bacteria and their enzymes, plants and microorganisms in drinking water, and even the spectacular sunsets caused by the eruption of Krakatoa. He also continued his work on plant galls and the wasps that cause them. "

          "The foundation stones for what later became known as microbiology and applied botany, and only much later biotechnology, were laid in a room looking just like this one. The furniture was made for Beijerinck in the late 19th-century and later used by Albert Jan Kluyver. The room also holds equipment from Gerrit van Iterson. The office of a professor teaching at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries would have served many different purposes. Usually it held not only a reference library, teaching and writing equipment, but it also sometimes functioned as a meeting room and simple lab. It was perfectly normal for scientists to carry out experiments in their offices. For that reason, in addition to the books and papers, you can see microscopes, weighing scales and chemicals in some of the cupboards. In the beginning of Beijerincks tenure, there was no electricity in the buildings and the professors used gas light. Therefore much of the equipment has been adjusted to work in low light circumstances. Enjoy your visit!"
