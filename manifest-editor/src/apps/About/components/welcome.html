<h1>The IIIF Manifest Editor</h1>

<h2>What's IIIF?</h2>
<p>
  IIIF, pronounced "triple-eye-eff", is a set of standards for working with digital objects on the web, such as
  digitised books, manuscripts, artworks, movies and audio. It's typically used by galleries, libraries, archives and
  museums to present their collections and make them <i>interoperable</i> - they become available to software such as
  viewers, annotation tools, digital exhibits and more. <a href="https://iiif.io/">Learn more at iiif.io</a>.

<h2>What's a Manifest?</h2>
<p>
  A Manifest is the <i>The unit of distribution</i> of IIIF. It's like a web page, but instead of HTML for browsers, it
  contains JSON data for IIIF-compatible viewers and other software. A IIIF Viewer loads a Manifest
  and generates the UI to allow the user to navigate around, e.g., from page to page of a book, or from scene to scene
  of an opera. This Manifest Editor allows you to create new Manifests - from scratch, or by adapting existing ones.
</p>

<h2>Canvases</h2>
<p>
  A Canvas is a bit like a PowerPoint slide - the virtual space that content is arranged on. A Manifest has one or more
  of these "slides" - for example, one for each page of a book - and each slide has content - most commonly, one image
  filling the whole Canvas. Rather than a Manifest having a simple list of images, it has a sequence of Canvases, and
  each Canvas has one (or sometimes more) images (or AV content).
