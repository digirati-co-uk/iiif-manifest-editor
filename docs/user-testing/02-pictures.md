## Test 2: Assembling images into a Manifest

The goal of this test is to create a simple manifest out of existing, hosted static images.

## Materials

To start, you need the URLs of 10 hi-res images, in JPEG format. These can be anything - artworks, your own photos - but they need to be on the web already.

A good source might be [NASA image galleries](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html), where all the images are public domain.
For example, from the [Apollo Image Gallery](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/images.html), you might collect these 10 image URLs (you can use these ones if you want!):

The text to use is provided at each step of this test script.

## Steps

### 1. Open the Manifest Editor

Visit [https://manifest-editor-testing.netlify.app/](https://manifest-editor-testing.netlify.app/).

If you have never been here before, you'll see a Splash Screen, which you can dismiss.
If you have been here before, your settings might automatically load the manifest you last worked on.

Either way, start a new Manifest with File -> New, and pick "Blank Manifest".

### 2. Add canvases

For each of your images, add a new Canvas, one by one.
Find the simplest way to add a Canvas.
You shouldn't need any information other than each URL in your list.

### 3. Preview your work

Once you have added 5 canvases or so, see what your work would like in the Universal Viewer, and in Mirador, by using the Preview feature.

Send a preview link to a friend, so they can see what it looks like too. (You can send to yourself for the test).

### 4. Finish adding canvases

Add the remaining images in the same way as before - as new canvases.

### 5. Add some descriptive information

Give your Manifest a _Label_.
Give your Manifest a _Summary_.

Pick a Rights Statement for your manifest.

Give each canvas a _Label_ (it doesn't matter what you call them).

### 6. Save your work more permanently

While the preview link is useful, it only lasts for 48 hours. 
This version of the Manifest is integrated with a "permalink" service.
Save your work more permanently, and send a link to the saved IIIF Manifest to a friend (or yourself).

### 7. Re-order the canvases

Re-order the canvases. Try:

- swapping two canvases
- moving the last canvas to the start
- moving a canvas from the middle of the manifest to the end

(hint? - do this in the grid overview)

### 8. Save again

Save the re-ordered manifest so that it replaces the original version with your original ordering.

### 9. "Save as"

Now change the order of the canvases again, and this time save the Manifest to a new URL, so you don't overwrite the previous version.
Send both old and new URLs to a friend (or yourself) - as if to ask, "which order do you prefer?"
