## Test 2: Assembling images into a Manifest

The goal of this test is to create a simple manifest out of existing, hosted static images.

## Materials

To start, you need the URLs of 10 hi-res images, in JPEG format. These can be anything - artworks, your own photos - but they need to be on the web already.

A good source might be [NASA image galleries](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html), where all the images are public domain.
For example, the from the [Apollo Image Gallery](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/images.html), you might collect these 10 image URLs (you can use these ones if you want!):

The text to use is provided at each step of this test script.

## Steps

### 1. Open the Manifest Editor

Visit [https://manifest-editor-testing.netlify.app/](https://manifest-editor-testing.netlify.app/).

If you have never been here before, you'll see a Splash Screen, which you can dismiss.
If you have been here before, your settings might automatically load the manifest you last worked on.

Either way, 




Re-order the canvases. Try:

- swapping two canvases
- moving the last canvas to the start
- moving a canvas from the middle of the manifest to the end
