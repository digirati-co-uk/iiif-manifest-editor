# Remixing IIIF

An exercise that uses the IIIF Browser to pick existing IIIF resources.

 - Add canvases from existing manifests
 - Add multiple selections from existing manifests
 - Add a single painting annotation from an existing canvas (i.e., not the canvas itself)
 - Add a painting annotation whose body is a crop, selected in the IIIF Browser.
