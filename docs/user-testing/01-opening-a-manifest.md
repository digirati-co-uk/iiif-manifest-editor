## Test 2: Opening a Manifest

The goal of this test is simply to open an existing Manifest and view its canvases.

## Materials

This is the URL of a IIIF Manifest:
https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b1932795x

(todo - one with canvas labels would be better)

### 1. Loading a Manifest

Opening the URL above in the Manifest Editor.

### 2. Exploring

Can you view the _Manifest Overview_ as a field of thumbnails?

If you select a thumbnail, can you see information for that _Canvas_?

Can you switch the Manifest Editor to a view that looks more like a slide deck, with a strip of thumbnails?

Can you switch the Manifest Editor to Outline view and explore the technical structure of the Manifest?
(You don't need to know what all the terms in this view mean).

### 3. Loading a different Manifest

Outside of the Manifest Editor, find a different IIIF Manifest (from anywhere you like)

Can you do the same things with this Manifest as you can with the first one?
