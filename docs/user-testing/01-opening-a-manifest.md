## Test 1: Opening a Manifest

The goal of this test is simply to open an existing Manifest and view its canvases.

## Materials

This is the URL of a IIIF Manifest:
https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b1932795x

(todo - one with canvas labels would be better)

### 1. Loading a Manifest

Opening the URL above in the Manifest Editor.

### 2. Exploring

Trying out different views: can you get an overview of the whole manifest? A visual idea of how many _Canvases_ it contains?

Can you see information for an individual _Canvas_?

What other views are available, and what do you think they mean? What are they telling you? 
What would you use them for?

### 3. Loading a different Manifest

Outside of the Manifest Editor, find a different IIIF Manifest (from anywhere you like)

Can you do the same things with this Manifest as you can with the first one?
