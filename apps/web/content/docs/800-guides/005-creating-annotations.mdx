The goal of this test is to explore how you create new annotations in the Manifest Editor.

## Materials

For this test, use this Manifest:
https://wellcomelibrary.org/iiif/b1932795x/manifest

### 1. Loading a Manifest

Opening the URL above in the Manifest Editor.

### 2. Comment on something of interest

Find an interesting feature on a page of the journal.
How would you make a _commenting_ annotation on this feature?

Can you draw a box round it?
Can you add some text?

### 3. Transcribe a piece of text

Find a brief run of text and transcribe it.
In IIIF, a transcription has the motivation `supplementing` - can you set that?

Are you able to declare what language your text is in?

### 4. Create a link to a Wikipedia page

Find a mention of a city or other place in the Journal.
Make a link from a box drawn around the text in the journal, to the Wikipedia page about that place.
(This annotation should have the motivation `linking`)

### 5. Save your new Manifest to a permalink

Save a copy of this Manifest (you can't save back to the original) and view it in Mirador.

### 6. Comments

Any comments on the processes here?
