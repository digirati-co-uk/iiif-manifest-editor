## Opening a Manifest

This is a self-test.

The goal of this test is simply to open an existing Manifest and view its canvases.

## Instructions

This is the URL of a IIIF Manifest:
[https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b18725259](https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b18725259)

(You can open that URL and look at it if you want, but don't have to).

Copy the Manifest URL above.

Now open the [Manifest Editor](/legacy)

Tell us what you are thinking as you look at the Manifest Editor and try the following:

Can you open this URL in the Manifest Editor?

Can you get a visual overview of the whole manifest?

Can you see individual _canvases_ (pages)?

Can you see information for an individual _canvas_?

What other views are available, and what do you think they mean? What are they telling you?
What would you use them for?

**Loading a different Manifest**

Outside of the Manifest Editor, find a different IIIF Manifest (from anywhere you like)

Can you do the same things with this Manifest as you can with the first one?

## Final message

Thank you for participating. The next tests involve changing content.
