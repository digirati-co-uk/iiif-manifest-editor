## Background

In 2017 we started working on [IIIF Manifest-driven narratives](https://medium.com/digirati-ch/reaching-into-collections-to-tell-stories-3dc32a1772af) for the V&A, and in 2018 for [Delft University of Technology Library](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZRXJaOYNbOD0jsOF79maKhxl5re4-2Kt/view). These were based on the first iteration of our [Canvas Panel](https://iiif-canvas-panel.netlify.app/) component.

In 2018 we developed an experimental [IIIF Workbench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHQdQ8Ti5eI&t=12s) for assembling complex canvases in a visual environment (like PowerPoint).

These combined to make a [IIIF Manifest Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8oA3rHbvPM) that in normal, default mode produces IIIF Presentation 3 Manifests, but can be extended with plugins to produce IIIF Manifests with particular structures and custom `behavior` properties, to drive custom viewing experiences - slideshows, guided viewing and the complex digital exhibition layouts seen in the Delft examples. Development of branches of the Manifest Editor for different clients went hand in hand with new viewers and static site generators.

## The new version

The new Manifest Editor builds on our experiences building content creation tools and custom viewing experiences. Our aim is for the new editor to be more sustainable, which in this context also means cheaper for ourselves and others to customise and adapt. This means a separation of viewing/previewing from content creation for most scenarios. We have ended up with multiple versions of the Manifest Editor, with different IIIF capabilities, user interfaces, and persistence mechanisms. Some versions integrate with our DLCS platform, allowing drag-and-drop creation of IIIF Image Services in real time.

We don't want to needlessly throw away the capabilities we have, but we want to maintain one editor going forward, that is simple and reliable to use, with excellent user experience. The needs of different adopters and users should be met by configuration, and choice of plugins, rather than different versions of the core editor.

## Audience

- People who want to learn IIIF
- IIIF novices using a visual, PowerPoint-like tool for creating Manifests intended for viewing in Universal Viewer, Mirador and other standard IIIF environments

- People who need tools to enhance existing (perhaps machine-generated) IIIF with additional information and structure
- Researchers and students assembling their own IIIF by remixing existing sources
- (and many more in the issues and discussions)
