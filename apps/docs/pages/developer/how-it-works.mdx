import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

In the [quick start guide](./quick-start) we used the `manifest-editor` package, and the `<ManifestEditor />` component directly to
get an instance of the editor running. This is a good way to get started, but it is not the best way to integrate the editor into a
production application.

Let's take a look at that `<ManifestEditor />` component to see how it works:

```tsx
import { Vault } from "@iiif/helpers";
import { Manifest } from "@iiif/presentation-3";
import { AppProvider, Layout, ShellProvider, mapApp } from "@manifest-editor/shell";
import * as manifestEditorPreset from "@manifest-editor/manifest-preset";
import { useExistingVault, VaultProvider } from "react-iiif-vault";
import invariant from "tiny-invariant";

const manifestEditor = mapApp(manifestEditorPreset);

interface ManifestEditorProps {
  resource: { id: string; type: "Manifest" };
  data?: Manifest;
  vault?: Vault;
}

export function ManifestEditor(props: ManifestEditorProps) {
  const vault = useExistingVault(props.vault);

  invariant(props.resource);
  invariant(props.data, "Data is required");
  invariant(props.resource.type === "Manifest", "Only Manifests are supported at the moment");

  if (!vault.requestStatus(props.resource.id)) {
    vault.loadManifestSync(props.resource.id, props.data);
  }

  return (
    <AppProvider appId="manifest-editor" definition={manifestEditor} instanceId="test-1">
      <VaultProvider vault={vault}>
        <ShellProvider resource={props.resource}>
          <Layout />
        </ShellProvider>
      </VaultProvider>
    </AppProvider>
  );
}
```

### IIIF Vault

There is quite a few things happening here, so lets start from the Vault.

Vault is a utility for loading IIIF Manifests, Collections and Annotations. It will convert older versions
of IIIF to the latest version, and it will also load the manifest from a URL if you provide one. It also
allows you to pull out Manifests from the Vault for exporting.

All of the editing in the Manifest Editor happens inside of the Vault. The Vault will store
data in a format similar to a Database, with a shallow version of each resource type:

```js
const vaultStorageExample = {
  Manifest: {
    "https://example.org/manifest": {
      id: "https://example.org/manifest",
      label: { none: ["My manifest"] },
      // ... All other properties of a Manifest ...
      items: [
        {
          // It stores references to other resources
          id: "https://example.org/canvas",
          type: "Canvas",
        },
      ],
    },
    Canvas: {
      "https://example.org/canvas": {
        id: "https://example.org/canvas",
        label: { none: ["My canvas"] },
        // ... All other properties of a Canvas ...
      },
    },
  },
};
```

This allows editing operations of the Manifest Editor to be fast and efficient, as it only needs to know the type and
identifier of the resource to make a change. UI elements also only need this information to react to changes.

There is a React library that makes working with, and loading resources into the Vault easy.

#### React IIIF Vault

Installation:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i react-iiif-vault
```

This package allows you to create Vaults and scope specific parts of your application to them. For example,
following from the quick start guide, we can add a custom Vault around the `ManifestEditor` component:

```ts
import { VaultProvider } from 'react-iiif-vault';
import { Vault } from '@iiif/helpers';
//...

const myCustomVault = new Vault();

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    <VaultProvider vault={myCustomVault}>
      <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh", display: "flex" }}>
        <ManifestEditor resource={{ id: data.id, type: "Manifest" }} data={data} />
      </div>
    </VaultProvider>
  );
}
```

Any components inside of the `VaultProvider` will have access to the Vault, so you can write custom UI that
subscribes to changes being made in the Editor.

For example, you could listen to a change in the Manifest label:

```tsx
import { useManifest } from "react-iiif-vault";

export function ManifestLabelUpdates() {
  const manifest = useManifest();

  if (!manifest) return null;

  // This will crash!
  return <h1>{manifest.label}</h1>;
}
```

Ah - but the manifest label is a language map, so we need to handle that:

```tsx
import { LocaleString, useManifest } from "react-iiif-vault";

export function ManifestLabelUpdates() {
  const manifest = useManifest();

  if (!manifest) return null;

  // LocaleString will choose a language based on the user's browser settings by default.
  return (
    <h1>
      <LocaleString value={manifest.label} />
    </h1>
  );
}
```

There are also some useful hooks for loading resources into the Vault:

```jsx
import { useExternalManifest } from "react-iiif-vault";
// ...me imports...

export function RemoteManifestEditor(props) {
  const manifestId = props.manifestId;
  // Load the manifest into the Vault
  // it returns:
  //   id: string;
  //   requestId: string;
  //   isLoaded: boolean;
  //   cached?: boolean;
  //   error: any;
  //   manifest?: ManifestNormalized;
  const { isLoaded, manifest } = useExternalManifest(manifestId);

  if (!isLoaded || !manifest) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <ManifestEditor resource={{ id: manifestId, type: "Manifest" }} data={manifest} />;
}
```

But you will need to ensure you wrap this component in a `VaultProvider` to ensure the Vault is available:

```jsx
export function App() {
  return (
    <VaultProvider vault={myCustomVault}>
      <RemoteManifestEditor manifestId="https://example.org/manifest" />
    </VaultProvider>
  );
}
```

In the `<ManifestEditor />` wrapper, we leave the loading of the IIIF to the external application.

It does this by using the `useExistingVault()` hook which looks for a Vault, or uses a global one, and
then it calls `loadManifestSync()` to load the manifest into the Vault.

### Manifest Editor

Let's take a look now at the structure of the Manifest Editor:

```tsx
<AppProvider appId="manifest-editor" definition={manifestEditor} instanceId="test-1">
  <VaultProvider vault={vault}>
    <ShellProvider resource={props.resource}>
      <Layout />
    </ShellProvider>
  </VaultProvider>
</AppProvider>
```

We have 4 main components here:

- `<AppProvider />` - App specific code
- `<VaultProvider />` - Providing the Vault (data store)
- `<ShellProvider />` - The "API" for the editing functionality
- `<Layout />` - The UI for the sidebars, main sections - populated by the app

We could change the "Manifest Editor" into a "Collection Editor" by changing what we pass
to the `<AppProvider/>`.

We could change which resource we are editing by changing the resource we pass to the
`<ShellProvider />`.

We could create a completely different layout for all the editors and UI by replacing
the `<Layout />` component. (Not covered in these docs!)

### Manifest preset

There is a package called: `@manifest-editor/manifest-preset` which contains all
of the UI, editors, creation forms and UI for editing Manifests. A preset consits of:

- Metadata (label, identifier, what types of IIIF it supports editing)
- Center panels - thumbnail grids, deep zoom viewers
- Left panels - appear on the left side of the screen, entry points for editing
- Right panels - default is just "editing" panel, but could be anything
- Modals - popups used in the application
- Editors - Which editors are available for each resource type
- Creators - Which forms are available for each resource type

The preset has access to the `<Shell />` which offers hooks for navigating from one panel
to another, and for selecting which resource to edit in the right sidebar. This essentially
allows the preset to control the entire UI of the application, but not the layout directly.

The different sections (left, right and center panels) are "slots" that can be filled with
components. The preset can define which components are used in each slot.

However, directly creating a preset from scratch is not recommended. It is better to
extend an existing preset.

To do that, you can use the `mapApp()` helper. In the example at the top, you can see that
the `<ManifestEditor />` wrapper uses this to load the preset:

```tsx
import { mapApp } from "@manifest-editor/shell";
import * as manifestEditorPreset from "@manifest-editor/manifest-preset";

const manifestEditor = mapApp(manifestEditorPreset);
```

There is a second optional argument that you can use to extend the preset.

For the hosted Manifest Editor, we extend the preset to include a config panel and a share modal:

<Callout type="info">We are looking at ways to make extending presets easier using helper functions.</Callout>

```tsx
const manifestEditor = useMemo(
  () =>
    mapApp(manifestEditorPreset, (app) => {
      return {
        ...app,
        layout: {
          ...app.layout,
          leftPanels: [
            ...(app.layout.leftPanels || []),
            {
              divide: true,
              id: "config",
              label: "Config",
              icon: <SettingsIcon />,
              render: () => <ConfigEditor />,
            },
          ],
          modals: [
            ...(app.layout.modals || []),
            {
              id: "share-modal",
              icon: <ShareIcon />,
              label: "Share workspace",
              render: () => <SharePanel projectId={id} />,
            },
          ],
        },
      };
    }),
  [project]
);
```

This allows you to add new panels, modals, editors, creators, etc. to the preset. You can also
filter and remove presets or panels that you don't want to see.

For example, if you are integrating this into a CMS, you might want to have an image
explorer panel that allows you to select images from the CMS to add to the manifest.

All panels inside have access to the Shell API, which allows you to navigate to different
panels but also to edit and save resources.

### Shell options

The shell provides a lot of the editing functionality of the application. It has a number of options:

- `config` - general configuration for the shell, hiding editors, creator, previews, i18n etc.
- `saveConfig` - An optional custom callback, if you wanted to save config changes externally
- `resource` - the resource that is currently being edited
- `previews` - A list of custom Preview configuration for previewing inside external viewers.

Check the [configuration](./configuration) and [preview](./previews) sections for more information.
