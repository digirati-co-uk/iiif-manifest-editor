# Saving Manifests

As mentioned in the [How it works](./how-it-works) section, you can pass a custom instance of Vault to the
Manifest Editor. This allows you to listen for changes and save the Manifest outside of the Editor when it changes
or on a user action.

There are two main strategies for saving the Manifest:

- Saving the Vault data directly
- Exporting the Manifest and saving it

The first approach is good for frequent changes as there is very little work needed to export that data. The second
approach is good for saving the Manifest to a file or a database - for use with other tools.

The rest of this page will assume that you have a handle on the `Vault` instance that you have passed into the
editor.

## Listening for changes

Manifest Editor shell package includes a React hook for listening to changes in the Manifest.

```jsx
import { useSaveVault } from "@manifest-editor/shell";


function App() {
  const vault = ...

  const saveVault = useCallback(() => {
    // Save logic here.
    vault.get(...)
  }, []);

  useSaveVault(
    // The instance of the vault.
    vault,
    // Callback to save the vault.
    saveVault,
    // How often it should save the vault (debounce)
    5000,
    // enable flag (optional)
    vaultReady
  );
}
```

You can use this hook outside of a Vault context and outside of the Manifest Editor context - since you pass
the Vault instance into it.

This is what the hook is doing under the hood:

```tsx
export function useSaveVault(vault: Vault, saveChanges: () => void, saveInterval: number, enabled = true) {
  const debounceSaveChanges = useDebounce(saveChanges, saveInterval);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window === "undefined") {
      return () => void 0;
    }
    window.addEventListener("beforeunload", saveChanges, false);

    return () => {
      saveChanges();
      window.removeEventListener("beforeunload", saveChanges);
    };
  }, [saveChanges]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (vault && enabled) {
      return vault.subscribe(debounceSaveChanges, true);
    }
  }, [debounceSaveChanges, vault, enabled]);
}
```

This handles saving the Vault data when the user closes the tab or the browser. It also debounces the save function
to prevent saving too often. Whenever anything in the Vault changes - the `saveChanges` function will be called.

The `vault.subscribe()` can take in a narrower set of changes to listen to, so you can take this and adapt it to
your needs.

## Saving the Vault data directly

Inside of the `saveChanges` function, you can save the Vault data directly. This is the "normalized" data that you
can save somewhere, like localstorage, and then use to rehydrate the Vault later.

```tsx
const vault = ...

const saveVault = useCallback(() => {
  // Save logic here.
  const data = vault.getState().iiif;

  // Save the data to localstorage
  localStorage.setItem("manifest-id-or-similar", JSON.stringify(data));
}, []);
```

This is a very simple example, if you wanted to restore the state of the Vault, maybe when a user reloads the page,
you can do something like this:

```tsx

function App() {
  const vault = ...
  const [isVaultReady, setIsVaultReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only run once.
    if (isVaultReady) {
      return;
    }
    // Get the data from localstorage
    const vaultDataText = localStorage.getItem("manifest-id-or-similar");
    const vaultData = JSON.parse(vaultDataText);
    // Set the data in the vault
    vault.getStore().setState({ iiif: vaultData as any });
    // Set the vault as ready
    setVaultReady(true);

  }, [vault]);
}
```

## Exporting the Manifest

You can also export the Manifest as a valid IIIF resource. You will need to know the ID of the
resource you are loading.

```tsx
const manifestId = 'https://example.org/manifest-1';
const vault = ...

const saveVault = useCallback(() => {
  // Returns Presentation 3 Manifest.
  const data = vault.toPresentation3({ id: manifestId, type: 'Manifest' });

  // Save the data to somewhere else...
  fetch('/api/save-manifests', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: {
      id: manifestId,
      data
    }
  });
  // ...
}, []);
```

This example takes more time to process, and for larger Manifests may decrease the user experience when saving.

For saving the full Manifest it's recommended to hook this up to a user action, like a "Save" button.
