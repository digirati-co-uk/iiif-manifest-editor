# Quick start guide

This guide will start from scratch to create a simple [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the Manifest Editor.

First we will scaffold a new Vite project with React.

```sh
npm create vite@latest 01-example-editor --template react
```

You can check the [documentation here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for how to use Vite with another package manager.

Now inside that new directory (`cd 01-example-editor`), we will install the Manifest Editor package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i manifest-editor
```

Running the following command will bring up the dev server:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Now you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the React app running.

**Global bug**

Currently there is a bug in one of the dependencies. You may need to add the following to your `vite` config if you run into an error:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  define: {
    // By default, Vite doesn't include shims for NodeJS
    "global.setImmediate": "((fn, ...args) => setTimeout(fn, 0, ...args))",
  },
});
```

This is a bug with the `draft-js` and hopefully a workaround can be found soon.

Next, we will add the Manifest Editor to the project. We will clear the contents of `App.tsx` and add the following code:

```jsx
import { ManifestEditor } from "manifest-editor";
import "manifest-editor/dist/index.css";
import "manifest-editor/reset.css";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/wunder.json")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setData(data);
      });
  }, []);

  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh", display: "flex" }}>
      <ManifestEditor resource={{ id: data.id, type: "Manifest" }} data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code fetches a manifest from the web and renders the Manifest Editor with that data. You should see the following in your
browser:

This is the minimal setup to get the Manifest Editor running in a Vite project. You will notice there are a few differences to the
hosted version of the Manifest Editor:

- You have to load the IIIF Manifest yourself
- There is no header, which usually includes the preview, sharing and export buttons
- We had to include 2 stylesheets: `index.css` and `reset.css`

Let's step through the code we wrote above to understand what is happening:

```jsx
import { ManifestEditor } from "manifest-editor";
import "manifest-editor/dist/index.css";
import "manifest-editor/reset.css";
```

First we import the `ManifestEditor` component from the `manifest-editor` package. We also import the default stylesheet and a reset stylesheet.

The `dist/index.css` includes all the styling for the Manifest Editor, but it assumes you have a CSS reset (e.g. [Tailwind preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight))
which is why we include the optional `reset.css` file.

The `<ManifestEditor />` component is a convenient packaged version of the editor. It takes two props:
