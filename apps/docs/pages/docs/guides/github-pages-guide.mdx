# Github pages guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Github Pages site to host your IIIF manifest. This is a great way to share your work with others, as it allows you to create a simple, static website that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

You can sign up for a free Github account at [github.com](https://github.com).

## Setting up your repository

The first step is to create a new repository on Github to host your IIIF manifest. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Github account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner of the page and select "New repository"
3. Give your repository a name and description, and choose whether it should be public or private

Once you have created your repository, you can start adding your IIIF manifest files to it. You can either create a new file directly in the Github interface, or upload an existing file from your computer.

## Creating your Github Pages site

Once you have your repository set up and your IIIF manifest files uploaded, you can create your Github Pages site. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the settings tab of your repository
2. Scroll down to the "Github Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select the branch that contains your IIIF manifest files
4. Click on the "Save" button

Your Github Pages site should now be live! You can access it by going to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>`. If you have any issues, check the settings tab of your repository to make sure everything is set up correctly.
