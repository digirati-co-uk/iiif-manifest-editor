# Creating exhibits or storytelling using IIIF Manifests

The Manifest Editor supports the creation and development of IIIF content for storytelling or exhibition style presentations. 

## Accessing the Exhibition editor

The Exhibition editor is a separate workbench view within the Manifest Editor, to allow users to create and curate their Manifests for presentation. The tools provided are more focussed to allow access to the necessary layout and behaviour properties to support the presentation of the content. Easy access to annotate your IIIF content, supporting your storytelling displays is also provided in this view.

- From the Manifest Editor, when you are ready to access the Exhibition editing tools to work on the IIIF Manifest you've created, click on the 'Settings cog' in the bottom left hand menu.
- This opens the Workspace configuration for the Manifest Editor.
- Clicking the link 'Go to Exhibition Editor' will open your Manifest in the editor:

## Introduction to the Exhibition editing mode

Your Manifest will open in the Exhibition Viewer as indicated in the screenshot above. The layout and structure is similar to the standard Manifest Editor workbench view.

The Manifest and it's Metadata properties are presented in the same way.

The main difference is how you interact with the Canvases in your Manifest, in this view.

The left hand panel allows interaction with the individual “slides” (aka Canvases) that make up the exhibition. These are simply the canvases which are present in the IIIF Manifest you are editing.

The centre grid view presents the contents of the IIIF Manifest, whilst the right hand panel presents the Manifest metadata.

## Editing the exhibition

Clicking the Exhibition Grid icon on the left navigation, opens the Exhibition grid view where you can see an outline of your exhibition.

There are a number of controls:

- 'Grid view' which enables you to view the exhibition as a grid, essentially providing a "Preview" of the exhibition you are creating.
- 'List view' you can toggle the 'Grid view' to display the slides in the exhibition as a list.
- 'Edit slides' allows you to reorganise and update the order of the "slides" (aka Canvases) within the manifest. You can also remove "slides" from the manifest using the three dot menu.
- 'Add a new slide' enables you to add IIIF content on a new slide (aka Canvas) to your exhibition manifest.

When you click on a slide in the left hand panel (or via the centre grid view), the right hand panel presents additional exhibition specific metadata options for each slide.

## Editing and updating your Exhibition manifest

As we are working with a IIIF Manifest created in the Manifest Creation and Editing step, a number of exhibition specific settings will need to be applied. These settings will determine aspects of the layout and behaviour of the exhibition manifest when viewed in the standalone Exhibition Viewer a little later.

When you click on a canvas, the right hand side metadata panel presents the 'Exhibition' tab, which contains an option to ‘Apply defaults’ which allows you to quickly select some basic layout options for the canvas based on the existing content.

When you select the 'Apply defaults' option for your exhibition slides (Canvases) this applys some basic settings to the slide content which determines how it is presented in the Exhibition Viewer.

When you navigate to the ‘Layout’ tab, you’ll notice what has been applied:

Aspect ratio

This will indicate a warning if applicable. You can use the ‘Size’ option to adjust the image appropriately and assess how well your changes apply to your selected content.

As you alter the size, you’ll see how the changes impact the exhibition layout in the left hand exhibition grid:

Behaviours

There are a number of layout behaviours that are available which can be applied to your slides:

    Text on left
    Text on right
    Text on bottom
    Only image

These determine how to present the slide (Canvas) Summary information presented on the ‘Summary’ tab in the right hand panel, when viewing the exhibition manifest in the standalone Exhibition Viewer.

In the example below, ‘Text on left’ is selected which will result in the Label and Summary text being presented in a text component next to the image within the Exhibition Viewer. The effect of this change can be partially previewed in the Grid view in the left hand panel:

Text on left
Summary

The 'Summary' tab presents the existing (Canvas) Label and Summary values if added for the current slide. This information can be presented as part of the exhibition, using the behaviour controls mentioned in the previous section.

These values can be edited and updated as needed.


## Creating a Tour of your Exhibition manifest

The 'Tour steps' tab allows further configuration of the interaction provided for each individual slide, when viewed in the Exhibition Viewer.

Each tour step that is created is saved as an annotation, as demonstrated earlier in the presentation, these annotations can be viewed in other IIIF enabled viewers (which support display of annotation).
