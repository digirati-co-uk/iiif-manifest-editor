# Getting started

To get started, navigate to the IIIF Manifest Editor (https://manifest-editor.digirati.services/)

If you have an existing IIIF Manifest you wish to edit, you can open that using one of the available options:

- Open manifest URL - paste the public URL of the specific manifest
- Open manifest file - browse to existing IIIF content on your local machine or network drive
- Browse for IIIF - this launches the IIIF Browser, enabling you to search through existing IIIF content to find a specific item.



## Opening an existing IIIF Manifest

Using the Open manifest URL option, you just need the URL for the Manifest you wish to open.

From the [Manifest Editor](https://manifest-editor.digirati.services) homepage, click on the "Open manifest URL" button at the top of the page. Paste the link in the text box, and click "Open", which will open the manifest for editing.

The "Browse for IIIF" option, allows you to browse, search and select a IIIF Manifest to open from a specific IIIF Collection. The section [Using the IIIF Browser](./using-iiif-browser) describes how to use this feature, which is available for easy access to existing IIIF content in various locations in the Manifest Editor user interface.

## Creating a new IIIF manifest

By default this will use [Theseus Viewer](https://theseusviewer.org) to display the Manifest. You can click on the drop down to select a different viewer.
