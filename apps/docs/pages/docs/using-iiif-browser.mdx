# IIIF Browser - discover and use existing IIIF content

The IIIF Browser is a feature that enables users to browse existing published IIIF content, enabling intuitive navigation through IIIF Collections and Manifests. A basic search option allows users to more easily find specific
items. 

## Using the IIIF Browser to open IIIF content

The IIIF Browser is available as an option on the Manifest Editor homepage, allowing users to select and open existing IIIF content. The following sections outline how you can use this option.

### Open the IIIF Browser

Click on the "Browse for IIIF" option:

This opens the default view of the browser; the first time you use this browser, you will see an empty browser as indicated in the screenshot below. Your browser storage will retain the links you visit for a limited
period, meaning you can return more quickly to IIIF content when you next use the IIIF Browser.

To start, select the URL of the IIIF content you wish to browse (this might be a IIIF Collection or a IIIF Manifest). Paste the URL into the browser URL bar as indicated in the screenshot below:

Click to open (or press return), and the browser will open the IIIF content.

### Browsing the IIIF content

Once you have selected and opened IIIF content, the IIIF Browser provides options to navigate and search the available content. 

- The browser presents the IIIF content in a list view by default or you can use the grid view to explore the content
- The browser presents navigation options allowing users to page through available content

Clicking on the available IIIF content will navigate you into that content, enabling you to explore further. In the screenshot below, selecting the Collection 'Dublin Gate Theatre Archive' opens that collection, enabling you
to browse the contents.

### Searching the IIIF content

You can use the "Search Collection" option to help find the appropriate content. This search uses the IIIF content labels to provide a basic search across the content you are currently accessing. In the screenshot below, entering the term 
'volume 12' has identified the most appropriate IIIF content matching that term in the selected collection.

## Using the IIIF Browser to add content to your manifest

You can use the IIIF Browser to discover and reuse existing IIIF content within your Manifest. You may want to add one or more canvases for example to your Manifest; or you might want to select a specific crop of an image
from an existing IIIF resource to include on your canvas.
