# Adding images

When you create a blank Manifest, you will be presented the following screen, which prompts you to add content to the Manifest.

Alternatively, if you click on the canvas list icon on the left side within your manifest, you can add a new canvas from the sidebar.

![](/add-canvas.png)

## Import options

When you add a new content you are adding a new IIIF Canvas to the Manifest. A IIIF Canvas can have multiple types of content. The most common type is an image, but you can also add a video or audio file.

You will be prompted to choose a content type. We will cover the following on this page:
- [Adding from an Image URL](#adding-from-an-image-url)
- [Adding from an IIIF image service](#adding-from-an-iiif-image-service)
- [Importing from existing IIIF](#importing-from-existing-iiif)

And then go over how to convert images from archive.org into IIIF compatible URLs, so you can use those images in your Manifests for testing.

### Adding from an Image URL
The most common way to add an image to a Manifest is to use a direct URL to the image. This can be a URL to an image on a website for example.

![](/add-image-url.png)

Simply paste the URL into the box and click "Create". The image will be added to the Manifest as a new Canvas.

<video controls src="/add-image-url.mp4" autoplay loop muted controls playsinline style={{ margin: '3em 0' }} />

### Adding from an IIIF image service

<video controls src="/add-image-service.mp4" autoplay loop muted controls playsinline style={{ margin: '3em 0' }} />

### Importing from existing IIIF

<video controls src="/existing-iiif.mp4" autoplay loop muted controls playsinline style={{ margin: '3em 0' }} />
