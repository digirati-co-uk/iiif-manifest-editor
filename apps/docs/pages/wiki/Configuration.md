(WARNING - ROUGH NOTES WIP)
(TODO - JSON Examples of Config)

Let’s not implement separate viewers for Ocean Liners, Mosaics; let’s do this all through config of the standard Manifest Editor.

* What’s editable
* What additional props / values are allowed and where
* Any additional @context to insert into the manifest
* What **tools** are available

### Config for Ocean Liners

* https://stephenwf.github.io/ocean-liners.json 
* Single canvas
* Annotations
* Capture model -> label, HTML with images, box

### Config for slideshow (micromosaics enhanced)

* https://iiif.vam.ac.uk/slideshows/gilbert/manifest.json 
* Multiple Canvases
* Canvas label
* Canvas 
* Canvas additional behaviours

Extended version, for capturing in-canvas transitions on next and prev
